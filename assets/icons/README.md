# WatchWise Extension Icons

You'll need to create these icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can use any simple icon or create a basic one with:
- A play button symbol
- Eye symbol
- Or any simple design

The extension will work without icons, but they make it look more professional.

## Quick Icon Creation Options:
1. Use an online icon generator
2. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
3. Use emoji as icons (convert to PNG)
